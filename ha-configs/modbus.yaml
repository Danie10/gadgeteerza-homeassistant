# Victron Configuration.  // If you require stats from your victron system you must have a Venus device installed as part of your
# Victron installation. This does not use VRM.This uses MODBUS sp Modbus TCP must be active on your CCGX.
# Slave IDs can be found at Settings / Services / Modbus TCP / Available services

# Multiplus slave: 246
# Smartsolar Charger slave: 247
# BalancelCell Battery slave: 225
# Download Modbus spreadsheet from https://www.victronenergy.com/support-and-downloads/technical-information called 'Modbus-TCP register list'
# Note HA probes the ACTUAL register number. Mbpoll polls one register ABOVE so reg 840 will be probed here as reg 841
# Start Troubleshooting by probing a register eg. 840 batt voltage on slave 100 with `mbpoll -a 100 -r 841 -c 1 192.168.1.205`

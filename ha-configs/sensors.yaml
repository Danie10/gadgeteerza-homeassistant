## sensors.yaml

# Create custom sensor to output conversion as total potential max of forecast for panel area
# Panel is 330W max for 1.94628m2 (8 panels = 15.57 m2 and 2,640 W max)
# Efficiency of panel is 16.97% (Scale of 0.1697 of forecast as their potential maximum)
# Weather station actual measured radiation 'sensor.thornton_solar_rad' is W/m2 (ignores efficiency of panels)
# Total (W) = W/m2 * panel area * efficiency
